# uda-distribution package

# Summary of the package:
>The package utilizes OOP to come up with a set of classes and methods of Binomial and Gaussian where on can read a file compute mean,standard deviation, Binomial/Gaussian(probability density function) as well a plotting bar graphs and bar charts from the given values

Generaldistiributon has the the parent from which Binomial and gaussian distributions files inherit the (Distribution) class.
The __init file makes python treat directiories containing as a module this acting like a short cut when calling various modules.
Test.py file has set of intructions through which code is made future proof incase of pontial fail or bug arises.
setup.py indicate that the installation module/package mostly packed and distributed especially when you in a vertual environment

# Installtion
