# Data-analyst-science-portifolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

### Contents
  ### Data Analysis and Visualization
  * [WranglingA](https://mutegimk.github.io/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/WranglingA) :This project invovles sourcing of data from different platforms, Cleaning the       dataset and perfoming visualization and docummenting the insights. Also here one requires a twitter developer account to get retweet and favourite count tweets as       you will in the notebook through API.
  
  * [Data Visualization](https://mutegimk.github.io/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/Data-Visualization) : This project has a couple of files but the main purpose for         this analysis was to deliver several insights from the melbourne housing dataset accompanied with relevant visuals and also factoring polices guiding quality of         visualization both in exploratory and explanatory analysis.
  
  ### Machine Learning
   * [Diabetes prediction](https://mutegimk.github.io/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/Diabetes-prediction) : This project predicts if the patient has diabetes or not          given the various medical data of the patients, Support vector machines (SVMs) is incoporated.
   
   * [House_prediction-XGBoostReg](https://mutegimk.github.io/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/House_prediction-XGBoostReg) : This project predict the prices oh boston        houses given the boston dataset using XGBoost regression.

  *  [House prediction-Ridge Regression](https://mutegimk.github.io/Data-analyst-science-portifolio/House-prediction-Ridge-Regression): The project was a case study of        Ridge Regression which is a popular type of regularized linear regression that includes an L2 penalty. This has the effect of shrinking the coefficients for those        input variables that do not contribute much to the prediction task.and also determing which the Hyperparameters of aplha is best for the given dataset.
